# Linux: Wallet & Miner - install and run

## Wallet:
- walletSystemPrep.sh = prepares the system
- walletInstallMUE.sh = installs wallet from sources

- sendmany.sh = solution for "Transaction too large" problem - works with most currencies!

## Miner:
- install-quarkminer-Neisklar.sh = installs miner from sources
- mueminerstart.sh = mines to my wallet, as a background process, with nicelevel 19, and 50% CPU usage limit

## Coin design:
